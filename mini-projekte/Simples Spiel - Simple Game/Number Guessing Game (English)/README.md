# Python Tutorial for Beginners: Creating a Simple Game in 10 Steps

Learn Python with this Simple Game Tutorial in only 10 Steps!

## Introduction:

Python is an easy-to-learn programming language that is widely used for its simplicity and versatility. In this tutorial, I will guide you through creating a simple game using Python. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a basic understanding of Python and be ready to explore its endless possibilities.

## Game Overview and Objective:

Our game will be a text-based guessing game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts. Let's dive into the step-by-step process of creating this game.

### Step 1: Setting Up the Environment:

To start, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Head over to the official Python website (python.org) and download the latest version of Python. Once installed, open a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) like PyCharm or Visual Studio Code to write your code.

### Step 2: Install Required Module:

We will be using the random module in this game. However, it is a built-in module that comes with Python, so no additional installation is required.

### Step 3: Create a New Python File:

Open your preferred text editor or IDE and create a new file. Save it with a .py extension, for example, `guessing_game.py`. This will be the file where you write your code.

### Step 4: Importing Required Modules:

Python provides built-in modules that can be imported to help us with various functionalities. We will start by importing the random module, which will enable us to generate a random number for the player to guess.

```python
import random
```

### Step 5: Generating a Random Number:

Using the random module, we can generate a random number between a specified range. Prompt the player to enter the desired range and generate a random number within that range. This will be the number the player needs to guess.

```python
def play_game():
    print("Welcome to the Guessing Game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")
    print("You have 5 attempts to guess the correct number.")

    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)
    attempts = 0
```

### Step 6: Implementing the Main Game Loop:

To allow the player multiple attempts to guess the number, create a loop that continues until the player either guesses the correct number or exhausts the maximum number of attempts. Prompt the player to enter a number and compare it with the randomly generated number. Provide appropriate hints to guide the player closer or further away from the correct answer.

```python
while attempts < 5:
    guess = int(input("Take a guess: "))
    attempts += 1

    if guess < secret_number:
        print("Too low!")
    elif guess > secret_number:
        print("Too high!")
    else:
        print("Congratulations! You guessed the correct number!")
        return
```

### Step 7: Adding Logic for Win/Loss Conditions:

Within the loop, keep track of the number of attempts made by the player. If the player guesses the correct number within the allowed attempts, display a victory message and end the game. If the player fails to guess the number within the specified attempts, display a failure message and reveal the correct answer.

```python
if attempts == 5:
    print("Sorry, you ran out of attempts.")
    print("The secret number was: ", secret_number)
```

### Step 8: Adding the Call for the play_game Function:

At the end of the loop, we calling the `play_game` function to start the game.

```python
play_game()
```

### Step 9: Saving and Running the Game:

Save the file you created with the .py extension. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the file is saved, and run the game by executing the command `python guessing_game.py`. The game will start, and you can play by entering your guesses.

### Step 10: Testing and Tweaking:

Run the game and test it yourself. Make necessary revisions or add your own creative flair. Experiment with different difficulty levels, allowing players to choose between a wider or narrower range of numbers.

## Conclusion:

Congratulations! You have successfully created a simple text-based game using Python. This tutorial has provided you with a solid foundation in Python programming while also giving you the satisfaction of creating something tangible. Keep exploring Python's vast library of modules and functionalities to expand your coding skills and unleash your creativity.

Remember, practice makes perfect. So take this opportunity to further enhance your creation, add new features, or even develop your own unique games using the knowledge you've gained. Python offers endless possibilities, and with dedication and curiosity, you can become a skilled Python developer. Happy coding!
